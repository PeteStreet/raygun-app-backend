**Python/GAE backend powering the app "Slogun"**

This is the Python social networking backend powering [Slogun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.drake.slogun), the Android app for people who love - and love to hate - the Midwest.  It utilizes the Google App Engine to allow users to customize their profiles, post snarky slogans about the Midwest, and interact with slogans posted by other users.  The design is inspired by [Raygun](http://www.raygunsite.com), the "greatest store in the universe".

The full Android project can be found [here](https://github.com/aleeeciaax3/SLOGUN).

I built this entire backend, including the files used for styling much of the Android frontend, from scratch and on my own time.  I will be adding user experience improvements to it periodically, based upon my running todo list and user requests.

**TODO:**
- Fix some styling issues related to "voting" on a slogan multiple times
- Add humanized timestamps to posts
- Introduce a non-Google accounts system
